I am first year PhD student in EECS department of University of California - Irvine. My adviser is [Athina Markopoulou](https://athinagroup.eng.uci.edu/athina/).

My research interest is security and privacy issues in AI-powered computing systems. My goal is to identify and mitigate emerging security risks associated with AI technologies. I aim to provide a secure environment for users to benefit from AI advancements, and a reliable platform for developers to exploit AI's potential while maintaining robust security standards.

Before I started my PhD, I worked with [Prof. Umar Iqbal](https://umariqbal.com/index.html), where we are developing a secure platform for LLM-based systems. Prior to my focus on security research, I spent two years in [Prof. Xiaojun Quan](https://sites.google.com/site/xiaojunquan)'s group, where I co-authored papers that were published in top conferences, focusing on NLP.
